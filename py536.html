        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <h3>
          Completed as part of PY 536: Quantum Computing, this project evaluated whether quantum computing
          will enable the discovery of a new pharmaceutical drug within the next decade. The analysis
          synthesized concepts from quantum algorithms, resource estimation, error correction, and
          pharmaceutical development timelines.

      <!-- My Contributions -->
      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <h3>
          - Co-authored a technical research paper evaluating the feasibility of quantum-enabled drug discovery<br>
          - Analyzed quantum chemistry resource estimates, including qubit requirements and logical gate depth<br>
          - Evaluated the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum error correction<br>
          - Compared theoretical simulation capability with realistic hardware projections<br>
          - Helped synthesize findings into a structured argument for the in-class debate

        <h2>In-Class Debate</h2>
        <h3>
          The project culminated in a 30–40 minute structured debate. My team argued the
          “Against” position, concluding that although quantum computing holds long-term promise,
          existing hardware constraints and fault-tolerance requirements make drug-scale
          simulation unlikely within the next decade.
          <br><br>
          Our side won the debate by a vote of 6–3.
        </h3>

      <!-- Key Findings -->
      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <h3>
          - Chemically accurate simulation requires on the order of 10¹¹–10¹³ logical gates<br>
          - Practical implementations would need approximately 10⁵–10⁶ physical qubits<br>
          - Current systems are multiple orders of magnitude smaller<br>
          - Drug development already requires 10–15 years in practice<br>
          - A quantum-discovered drug within the next decade is therefore unlikely

        This debate project was completed in partnership with <strong>Paul Case</strong>
        for our Quantum Computing course.
        Paul developed and presented the <strong>“For”</strong> argument, while I developed and
        presented the <strong>“Against”</strong> position. We collaborated equally on the
        research, technical writing, and development of the presentation slides and final paper.

        <h3>
          This project strengthened my ability to synthesize technical research, evaluate
          engineering feasibility, and communicate complex scientific concepts in an academic
          context. It also provided experience comparing theoretical potential with real-world
          technological constraints.
