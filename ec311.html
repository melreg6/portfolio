            In our MATLAB file, we initially read in an image and resize the image to our desired resolution. The data that is read in is converted into unsigned integer 8 bits, which is in a 3D matrix due to the RGB values. Afterward, the data that is going to be sent back is initialized as the same 3D matrix with zeros. To send the serial data through the UART, we are using nested for loops to send one byte at a time. These for loops access each pixel of the image, and each pixel has three bytes for the corresponding RGB values that get written into the UART and read back after the transmission. After every byte is processed, the processed image is displayed next to the original image.

            Both the transmitter and receiver modules make use of FSMs within their architecture made up of an idle state and a transmitting/receiving state to determine when data is transmitted.

            Receiver FSM:
            State 0: Waits for receiving signal (idle state)
            State 1: Receives the data bits one-by-one. The data is passed into the rxshiftreg and increments the counter. Once all bits have been received, it returns to the idle state.
            Transmitter FSM:
            State 0: Waits for transmit signal (idle state)
            State 1: Transmits bits one-by-one by shifting data and updating TxD. Once all bits are sent, it returns to the idle state.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <h3>
             A major setback to expanding the functionality of our project was our inability to change the transmitter and receiver modules to categorize our data to be able to differentiate RGB pixels that would allow for more color filtering and a variety of other transformations. We also had trouble storing all the data in a buffer/FIFO and transmitting it back. We think the cause of this issue is that the transmitter is constantly transmitting data back, so if we are storing multiple bytes of data, we would need to wait until the storage is full before transmitting. However, at the same time, MATLAB is always reading what is being transmitted. So, when we’d implement any sort of storage in Verilog, we would receive back a completely black image. This would be something we hope to solve in the future.
