        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>
          Developed a Pratt-style truss bridge using joint method analysis and matrix-based force computation.
          Designed two truss variations and evaluated load distribution, buckling risk, and load-to-cost efficiency
          using both code and manual calculations.
        </h3>

      <!-- Method -->
      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Truss Calculation Method</h2>
        <h3>
          Used the joint method with RREF matrix computations to solve for internal member forces. Negative force
          values indicated compression, while positive values indicated tension. Manual and code-based approaches
          were cross-validated for accuracy.

      <!-- Results -->
      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Results &amp; Comparison</h2>
        <h3>
          <strong>Design 1:</strong> Max load = 36.87&nbsp;±&nbsp;1.356&nbsp;oz &nbsp;|&nbsp; Load-to-cost ratio = 0.19 oz/$<br>
          <strong>Design 2:</strong> Max load = 31.26&nbsp;±&nbsp;1.849&nbsp;oz &nbsp;|&nbsp; Load-to-cost ratio = 0.165 oz/$<br><br>
          Both designs used 8 joints and approximately 110 inches of member length. Design 1 was selected due to its
          higher load capacity and better overall efficiency.

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>
          The Pratt truss design proved most effective for balancing strength and material cost. To further optimize,
          we recommend reducing member lengths through slight node position adjustments. Computer analysis improved
          accuracy and made it feasible to rapidly test multiple design iterations.
